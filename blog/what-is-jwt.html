        Historically, the most common form of authorisation would be the client
        first sending a login request to the server (consisting of a username
        and password). The server would then check that the credentials were
        valid and, if so, would then create a new session ID linked to the user,
        store it in memory and then return it to the client.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">
        The client would store this session ID as a cookie and suplies it on any
        subsequent calls to the server. The server would check which user this
        session ID is mapped to and check to see if that user is authorised to
        perform the requested method. If they are authorised, the server process
        and returns the response as expected.

      </h2>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">
        JWT authorisation works differently, in that when the user logs in,
        instead of the server storing the session information in memory, it will
        instead create a JSON Web Token and encodes and signs it with its a key.
        This last step ensures that the server will know if the token has been
        tampered with. Once the token has been created, it’s then returned to
        the client.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">
        The client can store the token however it wants, and provides it in all
        subsequent calls to the server. The server will first verify the
        signature on the token to make sure that it hasn’t been tampered with.
        Then the user can be extracted from the token and the server can process
        the request and return the response. One big advantage with this flow is
        that the user information is all stored within the JWT, so this can tell
        the server what actions the user is authorised to perform. This means
        that the server has to do less work as it doesn’t need to look up any
        information about the user at all.

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">
        A JSON web token consists of three parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">
          Header
        </li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">
          Payload
        </li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="26">
          Signature
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">
        These parts are seperated with a dot, so a typical JWT looks like this:
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">
        <code>xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz</code>
      </p>
      <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">
        <a id="Header_30"></a>Header
      </h3>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">
        The header typically contains two parts: the type of the token and the
        algorithm that has been used to create the signature
      </p>
      <pre><code class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="40" class="language-json">{
  "<span class="hljs-attribute">alg</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"RS256"</span></span>,
  "<span class="hljs-attribute">typ</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"JWT"</span>
</span>}
</code></pre>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">
        This JSON is Base64 encoded and that is used to form the first part of
        the JWT
      </p>
      <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">
        <a id="Payload_43"></a>Payload
      </h3>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46">
        The second part of a token is the payload and it contains the claims.
        Claims are statements about an entity (user) such as the
        username/customer reference, whether the user is an admin, expiration
        time or actions that the entity is allowed to perform.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="has-line-data" data-line-start="48" data-line-end="54" class="language-json">{
  "<span class="hljs-attribute">sub</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"1234567890"</span></span>,
  "<span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"John Doe"</span></span>,
  "<span class="hljs-attribute">admin</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
</span>}
</code></pre>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">
        There are three types of claims
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="58">
          Registered claims: predefined claims that are recommended to be
          included (but not mandatory) such as <strong>iss</strong> (issuer),
          <strong>exp</strong> (expiration time) and
          <strong>sub</strong> (subject)
        </li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="58" data-line-end="59">
          Public claims: claims that can be custom defined and that are either
          registered in the
          <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml"
            >IANA JSON Web Token Registry</a
          >
          or given collision-resistant names
        </li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="61">
          Private claims: claims that can be custom defined but that do not need
          to be collision resistant
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="62">
        Registered claims have keys that are only three characters long to to
        keep the tokens compact.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="63" data-line-end="64">
        The subject claim is very common and will be seen in most JWTs. It is a
        way to identify the entity that is performing the request, very similar
        to the session ID we saw in the previous section.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="65" data-line-end="66">
        Once this json has been structured, it is then encoded and used to form
        the second part of the token. Note that all claims can be decoded by
        anyone with access to the JWT, so in general, no secret data should be
        put here unless it is encrypted.
      </p>
      <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">
        <a id="Signature_67"></a>Signature
      </h3>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70">
        The final part of the token is the signature which is constructed by
        taking the first two encoded sections and using the algorithm specified
        in the header along with a secret:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="has-line-data" data-line-start="72" data-line-end="74" class="language-javascript">HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + <span class="hljs-string">"."</span> + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret);
</code></pre>

      </h4>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="77" data-line-end="78">
        When a client supplies the JWT in a subsequent request, the first thing
        the server will do is verify it. It does this by taking the header and
        payload and creating a signature as described above. Then it checks its
        generated signature against the signature in the token. If they don’t
        match, it means that the token has been tampered with in some way, and
        it rejects the request.
      </p>

        <a id="Why_use_JWT_79"></a>Why use JWT
      </h2>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="81" data-line-end="82">
        In traditional applications, any server you make requests to would have
        to be able to access the stored sessions in order to authorise the user.
        With JWT, the secret can be shared between as many servers as are needed
        and authorised by each. It also means nothing has to be stored in
        memory, so those resources can be used elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="83" data-line-end="84">
        JWT is also more compact than other types of tokens (SWT and SAML), so
        it’s more efficient to pass around in HTTP calls.
